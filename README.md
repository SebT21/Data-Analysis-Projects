Primarily SQL Codes Used to Analyze Datasets with Occasional Tableau Visualizations

All projects in the repository will have a number corresponding to their upload, as well as a brief description to match in this file. Actual explanations of my code be available as comments inside the corresponding files.
If a project has visuals done on Tableau, it will have ðŸ”µ	beside its name, otherwise there will be ðŸ”´. The link to my Tableau profile is in my profile page.
