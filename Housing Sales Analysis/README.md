# Housing Sales Analysis

Here we take a look at the housing market from 2007 to 2019 of an undisclosed Australian city (no information provided in the data unfortunately). Specifically, the growth of sales and the trends throughout the years is of interest, as well as the properties sold in each postal, by quantity and by price.

## Files Included:

- 'Housing Sales Analysis.sql' which has all the queries used to generate the tables present in this folder.

- Four spreadsheets containing queried results. These are referenced and imported for use in the Jupyter Notebook file.

- 'Housing Sales Notebook' contains explanations and insights of data and results, but more importantly, python code producing
  visualizations of all the queried results. I'm not sure if you can run the notebook here, but you can always copy the code and 
  sheets and create the graphs yourself while I figure out brining in images. You will need to install plotly for that. 
  
Feel free to pay with the data and codes however you want.
